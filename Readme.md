# N-Body Gravitational Simulation

## Overview

The N-Body Gravitational Simulation is a Python-based application that simulates the gravitational interactions between multiple celestial bodies (e.g., planets, stars) in a two-dimensional space. This project provides two versions of the simulation:

1. **Basic Simulation:** This version simulates the gravitational forces between bodies without considering collision dynamics. Filename -> nbody_sim.py

2. **Collision Dynamics Simulation:** In this version, the simulation includes collision dynamics, allowing bodies to collide, merge, and change their properties based on mass and collision conditions. Filename -> nbody_sim_w_collisions.py

## Features

- Gravitational interaction modeling using Newton's law of universal gravitation.
- Simulation of bodies with varying masses, velocities, and positions.
- Realistic collision dynamics and mass absorption.
- Visualization of the simulation with Pygame.
- Color-coding based on mass for better visualization.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame (for visualization)

## Getting Started

### Installation
